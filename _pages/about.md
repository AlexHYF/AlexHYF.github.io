Hello! I'm a forth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, working under the mentorship of [Prof. Mukund Raghothaman](https://r-mukund.github.io). My research is centered around program verification, program synthesis, and the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to programming languages. My ultimate goal is to help programmers develop more reliable software with greater ease.

My recent work focuses on using multiple information sources like LLMs, user feedbacks, test cases and etc. to improve the static analysis. When I'm not delving into my research, I enjoy learning natural languages(Japanese, French, etc.) and cooking.
