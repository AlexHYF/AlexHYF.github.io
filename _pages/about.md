Hello! I'm a forth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, working under the mentorship of [Prof. Mukund Raghothaman](https://r-mukund.github.io). My research is centered around program verification, program synthesis, and the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to programming languages. My ultimate goal is to help programmers develop more reliable software with greater ease.

My work is driven by a passion for making software development more intuitive and efficient, particularly through the innovative use of LLMs like OpenAI's GPT models. When I'm not delving into my research, I enjoy learning natural languages(Japanese, French, etc.) and cooking.
